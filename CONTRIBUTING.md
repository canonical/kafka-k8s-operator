# Contributing

## Overview

This documents explains the processes and practices recommended for contributing enhancements to this operator.

- Generally, before developing enhancements to this charm, you should consider [opening an issue](https://github.com/canonical/kafka-operator/issues) explaining your problem with examples, and your desired use case.
- If you would like to chat with us about your use-cases or proposed implementation, you can reach us at [Canonical Mattermost public channel](https://chat.charmhub.io/charmhub/channels/charm-dev) or [Discourse](https://discourse.charmhub.io/).
- Familiarising yourself with the [Charmed Operator Framework](https://juju.is/docs/sdk) library will help you a lot when working on new features or bug fixes.
- All enhancements require review before being merged. Code review typically examines
  - code quality
  - test coverage
  - user experience for Juju administrators this charm.
- Please help us out in ensuring easy to review branches by rebasing your pull request branch onto the `main` branch. This also avoids merge commits and creates a linear Git commit history.

## Requirements

To build the charm locally, you will need to install [Charmcraft](https://juju.is/docs/sdk/install-charmcraft).

To run the charm locally with Juju, it is recommended to use [LXD](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/introduction/) as your virtual machine manager. Instructions for running Juju on LXD can be found [here](https://juju.is/docs/olm/lxd).

## Build and Deploy

To build the charm in this repository, from the root of the dir you can run:
Once you have Juju set up locally, to download, build and deploy the charm you can run:

### Deploy

```bash
# Clone and enter the repository
git clone https://github.com/canonical/kafka-k8s-operator.git
cd kafka-k8s-operator/

# Create a working model
juju add-model kafka-k8s

# Enable DEBUG logging for the model
juju model-config logging-config="<root>=INFO;unit=DEBUG"

# Build the charm locally
charmcraft pack

# Deploy the latest Apache ZooKeeper release
juju deploy zookeeper-k8s --channel edge -n 3

# Deploy the charm
juju deploy ./*.charm -n 3

# After Apache ZooKeeper has initialised, relate the applications
juju relate kafka-k8s zookeeper-k8s
```

## Developing

You can create an environment for development with `tox`:

```shell
tox devenv -e integration
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Testing

```shell
tox run -e format        # update your code according to linting rules
tox run -e lint          # code style
tox run -e unit          # unit tests
tox run -e integration   # integration tests
tox                      # runs 'lint' and 'unit' environments
```

## Documentation

Product documentation is stored in [Discourse](https://discourse.charmhub.io/t/charmed-kafka-k8s-documentation/10296) and published on Charmhub and the Canonical website via Discourse API. 
The documentation in this repository under the `docs` folder is a mirror synched by [Discourse Gatekeeper](https://github.com/canonical/discourse-gatekeeper), that takes care of automatically raising and updating a PR whenever changes to the content on Discourse are made.
Although Discourse content can be edited directly, unless the modifications are trivial and obvious (typos, spellings, formatting) we generally recommend to follow a review process:

1. Create a branch (either in the main repo or in a fork) from the current `main` and modify documentation files as necessary.
2. Raise a PR against the `main` to start the review process, and conduct the code review within the PR.
3. Once the PR is approved and all comments are addressed, the PR should NOT be merged directly! All the modifications should be applied to Discourse manually. If needed, new Discourse topics can be created, and referenced in the navigation table of the main index file on Discourse.
4. Discourse Gatekeeper will raise a new PR or add new commits to an open Discourse PR, tracking the `discourse-gatekeeper/migrate` branch. The [sync_docs.yaml](https://github.com/canonical/kafka-k8s-operator/actions/workflows/sync_docs.yaml) GitHub Actions provides further details on the Gatekeeper integration that can be run (a) in a scheduled fashion every night; (b) as a part of pull request CI, and (c) can be triggered manually. If new topics are referenced in the main index file on Discourse, these will be added to `docs/index.md` and the new topics pulled from Discourse.
5. Once Gatekeeper has raised a new or updated an existing PR, feel free to close the initial PR manually created in step 2, with a comment referring to the PR created by Gatekeeper. If the initial PR was referring to a ticket, add the ticket to either the title or the description of the GateKeeper PR.
