  params:

      type: string
      description: The operation to issue to the balancer. This action must be called on the leader unit.
        'full' - runs a full rebalance of all partitions across the whole cluster
        'add' - evenly distributes replicas to new and available brokers
        'remove' - moves under-replicated partition replicas assigned to decommissioned brokers, to available ones

    Force refresh of first unit

    Must run with at least one of the parameters `=false`
  params:
    check-compatibility:
      type: boolean
      default: true
      description: |

        If `false`, force refresh if new version of Kafka and/or charm is not compatible with previous version

      type: boolean
      default: true

        Potential of data loss and downtime

        If `false`, force refresh if app is unhealthy or not ready to refresh (and unit status shows "Pre-refresh check failed")

      type: boolean
      default: true
      description: | 
        Potential of data loss and downtime during and after refresh

        If `false`, allow refresh to Kafka container version that has not been validated to work with the charm revision
  additionalProperties: false

resume-refresh:
  description: |
    Refresh next unit(s) (after you have manually verified that refreshed units are healthy)

    If the `pause-after-unit-refresh` config is set to `all`, this action will refresh the next unit.

    If `pause-after-unit-refresh` is set to `first`, this action will refresh all remaining units.
    Exception: if automatic health checks fail after a unit has refreshed, the refresh will pause.

    If `pause-after-unit-refresh` is set to `none`, this action will have no effect unless it is called with `check-health-of-refreshed-units` as `false`.
  params:
    check-health-of-refreshed-units:
      type: boolean
      default: true
      description: |
        Potential of data loss and downtime

        If `false`, force refresh (of next unit) if 1 or more refreshed units are unhealthy

        Warning: if first unit to refresh is unhealthy, consider running `force-refresh-start` action on that unit instead of using this parameter.
        If first unit to refresh is unhealthy because compatibility checks, pre-refresh checks, or workload container checks are failing, this parameter is more destructive than the `force-refresh-start` action.
