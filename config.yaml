options:
  compression_type:
    description: Specify the final compression type for a given topic. This configuration accepts the standard compression codecs ('gzip', 'snappy', 'lz4', 'zstd'). It additionally accepts 'uncompressed' which is equivalent to no compression; and 'producer' which means retain the original compression codec set by the producer.
    type: string
    default: producer
  log_flush_interval_messages:
    description: The number of messages accumulated on a log partition before messages are flushed to disk.
    type: string
    default: "9223372036854775807"
  log_flush_interval_ms:
    description: The maximum time in ms that a message in any topic is kept in memory before flushed to disk.
    type: string
    default: "9223372036854775807"
  log_flush_offset_checkpoint_interval_ms:
    description: The frequency with which we update the persistent record of the last flush which acts as the log recovery point.
    type: int
    default: 60000
  log_retention_bytes:
    description: The maximum size of the log before deleting it.
    type: string
    default: "-1"
  log_retention_ms:
    description: The number of milliseconds to keep a log file before deleting it (in milliseconds).
    type: string 
    default: "-1"
  log_segment_bytes:
    description: The maximum size of a single log file.
    type: int
    default: 1073741824
  message_max_bytes:
    description: The largest record batch size allowed by Kafka (after compression if compression is enabled). If this is increased and there are consumers older than 0.10.2, the consumers' fetch size must also be increased so that they can fetch record batches this large. In the latest message format version, records are always grouped into batches for efficiency. In previous message format versions, uncompressed records are not grouped into batches and this limit only applies to a single record in that case.This can be set per topic with the topic level max.message.bytes config.
    type: int
    default: 1048588
  offsets_topic_num_partitions:
    description: The number of partitions for the offset commit topic (should not change after deployment).
    type: int
    default: 50
  transaction_state_log_num_partitions:
    description: The number of partitions for the transaction topic (should not change after deployment).
    type: int
    default: 50
  unclean_leader_election_enable:
    description: Indicates whether to enable replicas not in the ISR set to be elected as leader as a last resort, even though doing so may result in data loss.
    type: boolean
    default: false
  log_cleaner_delete_retention_ms:
    description: How long are delete records retained.
    type: string 
    default: "86400000"
  log_cleaner_min_compaction_lag_ms:
    description: The minimum time a message will remain uncompacted in the log. Only applicable for logs that are being compacted.
    type: string 
    default: "0"
  log_cleanup_policy:
    description: "The default cleanup policy for segments beyond the retention window. A comma separated list of valid policies. Valid policies are: 'delete' and 'compact'"
    type: string
    default: delete
  log_message_timestamp_type:
    description: Define whether the timestamp in the message is message create time or log append time. The value should be either 'CreateTime' or 'LogAppendTime'.
    type: string
    default: CreateTime
  ssl_cipher_suites:
    description: A list of cipher suites. This is a named combination of authentication, encryption, MAC and key exchange algorithm used to negotiate the security settings for a network connection using TLS or SSL network protocol. By default all the available cipher suites are supported.
    type: string
    default: ""
  replication_quota_window_num:
    description: The number of samples to retain in memory for replication quotas.
    type: int
    default: 11
  zookeeper_ssl_cipher_suites:
    description: Specifies the enabled cipher suites to be used in ZooKeeper TLS negotiation (csv). Overrides any explicit value set via the zookeeper.ssl.ciphersuites system property (note the single word "ciphersuites"). The default value of null means the list of enabled cipher suites is determined by the Java runtime being used.
    type: string
    default: ""
