## Overview

Charmed Apache Kafka K8s delivers automated operations management [from Day 0 to Day 2](https://codilime.com/blog/day-0-day-1-day-2-the-software-lifecycle-in-the-cloud-age/) on the [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org) event streaming platform deployed on top of a [Kubernetes cluster](https://kubernetes.io/). It is an open source, end-to-end, production ready data platform on top of cloud native technologies.

The Charmed Operator can be found on [Charmhub](https://charmhub.io/kafka-k8s) and it comes with features such as:

- Fault-tolerance, replication, scalability and high-availability out-of-the-box.
- SASL/SCRAM auth for Broker-Broker and Client-Broker authentication enabled by default.
- Access control management supported with user-provided ACL lists.

As currently Apache Kafka requires a paired Apache ZooKeeper deployment in production, this operator makes use of the [Charmed Apache ZooKeeper K8s](https://github.com/canonical/zookeeper-k8s-operator) for various essential functions.

## Requirements

For production environments, it is recommended to deploy at least 5 nodes for Apache Zookeeper and 3 for Apache Kafka.

The following minimum requirements are meant to be for a production environment:

- 64GB of RAM
- 24 cores
- 12 storage devices
- 10 GbE card

The charm can be deployed in much smaller environments if needed.

## Usage

This section demonstrates basic usage of Charmed Apache Kafka K8s.
For more information on how to perform typical tasks, see the How to guides section of the [Charmed Apache Kafka K8s documentation](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/charmed-kafka-k8s/4/).

### Deployment

Charmed Apache Kafka K8s can be deployed as follows:

```bash
juju deploy kafka-k8s -n 5 --config roles="controller" controller
juju deploy kafka-k8s -n 3 --config roles="broker"
```

After this, it is necessary to integrate them:

```bash
juju integrate kafka-k8s:peer-cluster-orchestrator controller:peer-cluster
```

To watch the process, the `juju status` command can be used.
Once all the units are shown as `active|idle`, the credentials to access a broker
can be set using Juju secrets, discussed in the **Password Rotation** section.

Note that Charmed Apache Kafka cluster is secure-by-default:
when no other application is integrated to Charmed Apache Kafka K8s, listeners are disabled,
thus preventing any incoming connection.
If there are no other applications, you can deploy a `data-integrator`
charm and integrate it to Charmed Apache Kafka to enable listeners.

### Scaling

The charm can be scaled using `juju scale-application` command:

```shell
juju scale-application kafka-k8s <num_of_units_to_scale_to>
```

This will add or remove brokers to match the required number.
For example, to scale a deployment to 5 units, run:

```shell
juju scale-application kafka-k8s 5
```

### Password rotation

The `admin` user is used internally by the Charmed Apache Kafka K8s operator.
The password for this user can be set using Juju secrets.
The process to set or change the password is described below.  

First, add a custom secret for the internal `admin` user with your desired password:

```bash
juju add-secret mysecret admin=My$trongP4ss
```

You will receive a secret ID in response, for example:

```text
secret:cvh7kruupa1s46bqvuig
```

Then, grant access to the secret with:

```bash
juju grant-secret mysecret kafka-k8s
```

Finally, configure the Apache Kafka application to use the provided secret:

```bash
juju config kafka-k8s system-users=secret:cvh7kruupa1s46bqvuig
```

### Storage support

Currently, the Charmed Apache Kafka Operator supports 1 or more storage volumes.
By default, a 10G storage volume tied to a
[Kubernetes PVC](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/)
is installed.

This storage is mounted on `/var/lib/data/kafka` and used for log-data.

Service logs can be found in `/var/log/kafka`.

When storage is added or removed, the Apache Kafka service will restart
to ensure it uses the new volumes. Additionally, logs and charm status messages will prompt users
to manually reassign partitions so that the new storage volumes are populated.
By default, Apache Kafka will not assign partitions to new directories/units until existing
topic partitions are assigned to it, or a new topic is created.

## Relations

The Charmed Apache Kafka K8s Operator supports Juju
[relations](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/juju/3.6/reference/relation/)
for interfaces listed below.

### The Kafka_client interface

The `kafka_client` interface is used with the [Data Integrator](https://charmhub.io/data-integrator)
charm, which upon relation automatically provides credentials and endpoints for connecting
to the desired product.

To deploy the `data-integrator` charm with the desired `topic-name` and user roles:

```shell
juju deploy data-integrator
juju config data-integrator topic-name=test-topic extra-user-roles=producer,consumer
```

To integrate the two applications:

```shell
juju integrate data-integrator kafka-k8s
```

To retrieve information, enter:

```shell
juju run data-integrator/leader get-credentials --wait
```

The output looks like this:

```yaml
unit-data-integrator-0:
  UnitId: data-integrator/0
  id: "4"
  results:
    kafka:
      consumer-group-prefix: relation-27- 
      endpoints: 10.123.8.133:19092
      password: ejMp4SblzxkMCF0yUXjaspneflXqcyXK 
      tls: disabled 
      username: relation-27 
    ok: "True"
  status: completed
  timing:
    completed: 2023-01-27 14:22:51 +0000 UTC 
    enqueued: 2023-01-27 14:22:50 +0000 UTC
    started: 2023-01-27 14:22:51 +0000 UTC
```

### The tls-certificates interface

The `tls-certificates` interface is used with the `tls-certificates-operator` charm.

To enable TLS, deploy the TLS charm first:

```shell
juju deploy tls-certificates-operator
```

Then, add the necessary configurations:

```shell
juju config tls-certificates-operator generate-self-signed-certificates="true" ca-common-name="Test CA" 
```

And enable TLS by relating the application to the `tls-certificates` charm:

```shell
juju integrate tls-certificates-operator kafka-k8s
```

Now you can generate shared internal key:

```shell
openssl genrsa -out internal-key.pem 3072
```

And apply keys on each Charmed Apache Kafka K8s unit:

```shell
juju run kafka-k8s/0 set-tls-private-key "internal-key=$(base64 -w0 internal-key.pem)"
juju run kafka-k8s/1 set-tls-private-key "internal-key=$(base64 -w0 internal-key.pem)"
juju run kafka-k8s/2 set-tls-private-key "internal-key=$(base64 -w0 internal-key.pem)"
```

To disable TLS remove the relation:

```shell
juju remove-relation kafka-k8s tls-certificates-operator
```

> **Note**: The TLS settings here are for self-signed-certificates which are not recommended for production clusters, the `tls-certificates-operator` charm offers a variety of configurations, read more on the TLS charm in the [documentation](https://charmhub.io/tls-certificates-operator).

## Monitoring

The Charmed Apache Kafka K8s operator comes with the [JMX exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/jmx_exporter/).
The metrics can be queried by accessing the `http://<unit-ip>:9101/metrics` endpoint.

Additionally, the charm provides integration with the [Canonical Observability Stack](https://charmhub.io/topics/canonical-observability-stack).

Deploy `cos-lite` bundle in a separate model.
This can be done by following the
[deployment tutorial](https://charmhub.io/topics/canonical-observability-stack/tutorials/install-microk8s).
It is needed to offer the endpoints of the COS relations.
The [offers-overlay](https://github.com/canonical/cos-lite-bundle/blob/main/overlays/offers-overlay.yaml)
can be used, and this step is shown on the COS tutorial.

Next, deploy [Grafana Agent](https://charmhub.io/grafana-agent) and follow the
[tutorial](https://discourse.charmhub.io/t/using-the-grafana-agent-machine-charm/8896)
to integrate it to the COS Lite offers.

Now, integrate Apache Kafka with the Grafana Agent:

```bash
juju integrate kafka-k8s grafana-agent
```

After this is complete, Grafana will show two new dashboards: `Kafka Metrics` and `Node Exporter Kafka`.
