# Apache Kafka listeners

Charmed Apache Kafka K8s comes with a set of listeners that can be enabled for
inter-broker and broker-controller communication, and for client communication. 

*Internal listeners* are used for internal traffic and exchange of information 
between Apache Kafka brokers and controllers. These will be created by default.

*Client listeners* are used for external clients, and are optionally enabled
based on the relations created on particular charm endpoints.
Each listener is characterised by a specific port, scope and protocol. 

In the following table, we summarise the protocols, the port and
the relation that each listener is bound to. Note that based on whether a `certificates`
relation is present, one of two mutually exclusive types of listeners can be 
opened.
