# File system paths

In the following table, we summarise some of the most relevant file paths used in the Apache Kafka and Apache ZooKeeper charms.

## Apache Kafka

|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| `/opt/kafka`          | Binary files for the Charmed Apache Kafka K8s distribution. Note that this is a read-only Squashfs file system.                                                                                                   | (owned by `kafka`)                    | 
| `/opt/kafka/bin/*.sh` | General bash scripts to provide helpers and utilities for managing and interacting with Apache Kafka.                                                                                                        | (owned by `kafka`)                    |

| `/var/log/kafka/`     | Application Logging files generated by the Apache Kafka daemon process. These files are written by the workload, but they may be read by other components to provide monitoring (e.g. Grafana and/or charm). | (owned and managed by `kafka`)        |
| `/var/lib/kafka/`     | Raw data is stored persistently by Apache Kafka during its operations. The files are written and managed by Apache Kafka only.                                                                                         | (owned and managed by `kafka`)        |

| `/opt/zookeeper/bin/*.sh`  | General bash scripts to provide helpers and utilities for managing and interacting with Apache ZooKeeper.                                                                                                        | (owned by `zookeeper`)                    |

| `/var/log/zookeeper/`      | Application Logging files generated by the Apache ZooKeeper daemon process. These files are written by the workload, but they may be read by other components to provide monitoring (e.g. Grafana and/or charm). | (owned and managed by `zookeeper`)        |
| `/var/lib/zookeeper/`     | Raw data is stored persistently by Apache ZooKeeper during its operations. The files are written and managed by Apache ZooKeeper only.                                                                                     | (owned and managed by `zookeeper`)        |

External storage is used for storing persistent raw data, and it is  
mounted at `/var/lib/zookeeper`.
