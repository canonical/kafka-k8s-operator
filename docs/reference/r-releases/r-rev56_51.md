## Technical notes

* A Charmed Apache Kafka K8s cluster is secure by default, meaning that when deployed if there are no client charms related to it, external listeners will not be enabled.
* We recommend to deploy one `data-integrator` with `extra-user-roles=admin` alongside the Apache Kafka deployment, in order to enable listeners and also create one user with elevated permission 
  to perform administrative tasks. For more information, see the [How-to manage application](/t/charmed-kafka-k8s-how-to-manage-app/10293) guide.
* The current version of Apache Kafka does not yet support direct integration with Ingress, NodePort or LoadBalancer services. We recommend using it for usage within the K8s network.
* The current release has been tested with Juju 2.9.45+ and Juju 3.1+
* Inplace upgrade for charms tracking `latest` is not supported, both for Apache ZooKeeper and Apache Kafka charms. Perform data migration to upgrade to a Charmed Apache Kafka cluster managed via a `3/stable` charm. 
  For more information on how to perform the migration, see [How-to migrate a cluster](/t/charmed-kafka-documentation-how-to-migrate-a-cluster/10951) guide.
