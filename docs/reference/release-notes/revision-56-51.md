| Charm | Revision | Hardware architecture | Juju version | Artefacts |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Charmed Apache Kafka K8s | [56](https://github.com/canonical/kafka-k8s-operator/tree/rev56) | AMD64 | 2.9.45+, Juju 3.1+ | Distribution: [3.6.0-ubuntu0](https://launchpad.net/kafka-releases/3.x/3.6.0-ubuntu0). <br> `charmed-kafka` rock: [{spellexception}`sha256:4b3495`](https://github.com/canonical/charmed-kafka-rock/pkgs/container/charmed-kafka/169796414). |
| Charmed Apache ZooKeeper K8s | [51](https://github.com/canonical/zookeeper-k8s-operator/tree/rev51) | AMD64 | 2.9.45+, Juju 3.1+ | Distribution: [3.8.2-ubuntu0](https://launchpad.net/zookeeper-releases/3.x/3.8.2-ubuntu0). <br> `charmed-zookeeper` rock: [{spellexception}`sha256:a7a004`](https://github.com/canonical/charmed-zookeeper-rock/pkgs/container/charmed-zookeeper/169796097). |

## Known issues

* Revision 126 of Charmed Apache ZooKeeper was observed to sporadically trigger Apache ZooKeeper reconfiguration of the clusters by removing all servers but the Juju leader from the Apache ZooKeeper quorum.
This leads to a non-highly available cluster, that it is however still up and running.
  * Recommendation: Upgrade to a newer version: revision 136+.
* The current version of Apache Kafka does not yet support direct integration with Ingress, NodePort or Load Balancer services.
  * Recommendation: We recommend using it within the K8s network.
