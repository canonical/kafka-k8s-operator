# Charm statuses

A deployed charm follows [standard Juju applications statuses](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/juju/3.6/reference/status/#application-status). Here you can find the expected reactions on different statuses:

## Apache Kafka

| Juju Status     | Message                                                                    | Expectations                                                                                                                                                                                        | Actions                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| **Active**      | manual partition reassignment may be needed to utilise new storage volumes | Existing data is not automatically rebalanced when new storage is attached.

| **Active**      | potential data loss due to storage removal without replication             | Some partition/topics are not replicated on multiple storages, therefore potentially leading to data loss                                                                                           | Add new storage, increase replication of topics/partitions and/or rebalance data across multiple storages/brokers                                                                        |
| **Active**      | sysctl params cannot be set.
