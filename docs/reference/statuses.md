# Charm statuses

A deployed charm follows [standard Juju applications statuses](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/juju/latest/reference/status/#application-status). Here you can find the expected reactions on many typical Charmed Apache Kafka K8s statuses:

| Juju Status | Message                                                                    | Expectations                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Actions                                                                                                                                               |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Active      |                                                                            | Normal charm operations                                                                                                                                                                                             | No actions required                                                                                                                                   |
| Active      | manual partition reassignment may be needed to utilise new storage volumes | Existing data is not automatically rebalanced when new storage is  attached. New storage will be used for newly created topics and/or  partitions                                                                   | Inspect the storage utilisation and based on the need, and rebalance data across multiple storages/brokers                                            |
| Active      | potential data loss due to storage removal without replication             | Some partition/topics are not replicated on multiple storages, therefore potentially leading to data loss                                                                                                           | Add new storage, increase replication of topics/partitions and/or rebalance data across multiple storages/brokers                                     |
| Active      | machine system settings are not optimal - see logs for info                | The broker is running on a machine that has sub-optimal OS settings.  Although this may not preclude Apache Kafka to work, it may result in  sub-optimal performances                                               | Check the juju debug-log for insights on which settings are sub-optimal and may be changed                                                            |
| Active      | sysctl parameters cannot be set. Is the machine running on a container?    | Some of the sysctl settings required by Apache Kafka could not be  set, therefore affecting Apache Kafka performance and correct settings.  This can also be due to the charm being deployed on the wrong substrate | Remove the deployment and make sure that the selected charm is correct given the Juju cloud substrate                                                 |
| Blocked     | unable to install {spellexception}`charmed-kafka` snap                       | There are issues with the network connection and/or the snap Store                                                                                                                                                  | Check your internet connection and Snapcraft.io status. Remove the application and when everything is OK, deploy the charm again                      |

Otherwise, check the Apache Kafka logs for insights on the issue                                                        |
