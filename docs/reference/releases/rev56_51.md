## Technical notes

* Kafka cluster is secured-by default, meaning that when deployed if there are no client charms related to it, external listeners will not be enabled.
* We recommend to deploy one `data-integrator` with `extra-user-roles=admin` alongside the Kafka deployment, in order to enable listeners and also create one user with elevated permission 
  to perform administrative tasks. See the [How-to manage application](/t/charmed-kafka-documentation-how-to-manage-app/10285) userguide for more information.
* The current version of Kafka does not yet support direct integration with Ingress, NodePort or LoadBalancer services. We recommend to use it for usage within the K8s network.  
* The current release was tested and provides compatibility with Juju 2.9.45+ and Juju 3.1+
* Inplace upgrade for charms tracking `latest` is not supported, both for ZooKeeper and Kafka. Perform a migration of the data to upgrade to a Kafka cluster managed via a `3/stable` charm. 
  Refer to the [How-to migrate a cluster](/t/charmed-kafka-documentation-how-to-migrate-a-cluster/10951) user guide available for VM for more information on how to achieve this.
