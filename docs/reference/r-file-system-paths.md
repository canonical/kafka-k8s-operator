# File System Path

In the following table, we summarize some of the most relevant file paths used in the Kafka and ZooKeeper charms.

## Kafka

|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| /opt/kafka          | Binary files for the Charmed Kafka distribution. Note that this is a read only squashfs file system.                                                                                                   | (owned by `kafka`)                    | 
| /opt/kafka/bin/*.sh | General bash scripts to provide helpers and utilities for managing and interacting with Kafka.                                                                                                        | (owned by `kafka`)                    |

External storage is used for storing persistent raw data, and it is  
mounted at `/var/lib/zookeeper`.
