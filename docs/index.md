# Charmed Kafka K8s Documentation

The Charmed Kafka K8s Operator delivers automated operations management from day 0 to day 2 on the [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org) event streaming platform deployed on top of a [Kubernetes cluster](https://kubernetes.io/). It is an open source, end-to-end, production ready data platform on top of cloud native technologies.

This operator charm comes with features such as:
- Fault-tolerance, replication, scalability and high-availability out-of-the-box.
- SASL/SCRAM auth for Broker-Broker and Client-Broker authentication enabled by default.
- Access control management supported with user-provided ACL lists.

The Kafka K8s Operator uses the latest upstream Kafka binaries released by The Apache Software Foundation that comes with Kafka, made available using the [`ubuntu/kafka` OCI image](https://registry.hub.docker.com/r/ubuntu/kafka) distributed by Canonical.

As currently Kafka requires a paired ZooKeeper deployment in production, this operator makes use of the [ZooKeeper K8s Operator](https://github.com/canonical/zookeeper-k8s-operator) for various essential functions.

The Charmed Kafka K8s operator comes in two flavours to deploy and operate Kafka on [physical/virtual machines](https://github.com/canonical/kafka-operator) and [Kubernetes](https://github.com/canonical/kafka-k8s-operator). Both offer features such as replication, TLS, password rotation, and easy to use integration with applications. The Charmed Kafka K8s Operator meets the need of deploying Kafka in a structured and consistent manner while allowing the user flexibility in configuration. It simplifies deployment, scaling, configuration and management of Kafka in production at scale in a reliable way.
