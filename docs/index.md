# Charmed Apache Kafka K8s documentation

Charmed Apache Kafka K8s is an open-source operator that makes it easier to manage Apache Kafka on Kubernetes, with built-in support for enterprise features.

Apache Kafka is a free, open-source software project by the Apache Software Foundation. Users can find out more at the [Apache Kafka project page](https://kafka.apache.org).

Charmed Apache Kafka K8s is built on top of [Juju](https://juju.is/) and reliably simplifies the deployment, scaling, design, and management of Apache Kafka on Kubernetes in production. Additionally, you can use the charm to manage your Apache Kafka clusters with automation capabilities. It also offers replication, TLS, password rotation, easy-to-use application integration, and monitoring.
Charmed Apache Kafka K8s operates Apache Kafka on different Kubernetes distributions, featuring support for both on-premise installation (e.g. using MicroK8s) or cloud services (e.g. AWS EKS).

Charmed Apache Kafka K8s is a solution designed and developed to help ops teams and
administrators to automate Apache Kafka operations from [Day 0 to Day 2](https://codilime.com/blog/day-0-day-1-day-2-the-software-lifecycle-in-the-cloud-age/), across multiple cloud environments and platforms.

Canonical has also developed the [Charmed Apache Kafka operator](https://charmhub.io/kafka) to support Apache Kafka in VM/IAAS environments.

Charmed Apache Kafka K8s is developed and supported by [Canonical](https://canonical.com/), as part of its commitment to 
provide open-source, self-driving solutions, seamlessly integrated using the Operator Framework Juju. Please 
refer to [Charmhub.io](https://charmhub.io/), for more Charmed operators that can be integrated by [Juju](https://juju.is/).
