# Charmed Apache Kafka K8s documentation

Charmed Apache Kafka K8s is an open-source software operator, packaged as a
[Juju charm](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/juju/latest/reference/charm/),
that simplifies the deployment, scaling, and management of Apache Kafka clusters
on Kubernetes.

[Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org) is a free, open-source software project
by the Apache Software Foundation.

The charm helps ops teams and administrators automate Apache Kafka operations from
[Day 0 to Day 2](https://codilime.com/blog/day-0-day-1-day-2-the-software-lifecycle-in-the-cloud-age/)
with additional capabilities, such as: replication, TLS encryption, password rotation,
easy-to-use application integration, and monitoring.
