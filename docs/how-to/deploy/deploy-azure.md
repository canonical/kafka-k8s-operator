# How to deploy on Azure

[Azure](https://azure.com/) is the cloud computing platform developed by Microsoft. It has management, access and development of applications and services to individuals, companies, and governments through its global infrastructure. Access the Azure web console at [portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com/).

## Install client environment

```{warning}
Current limitations:

* Only supported starting Juju 3.6
* Juju CLI should be on Azure VM for it to be able to reach cloud metadata endpoint.
* Managed Identity and the Juju resources should be on the same Azure subscription
* The current setup has been tested on Ubuntu 22.04 and higher
```

### Juju

Install Juju via snap:

```shell
sudo snap install juju
```

Check that the Juju version is correctly installed:

```shell
juju version
```

<details>

<summary> Output example</summary>

```shell
3.6-rc1-genericlinux-amd64
```

</details>

### Azure CLI

Install the Azure CLI on Linux distributions by following the [Azure CLI installation guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-linux?pivots=apt).

Verify that it is correctly installed:

```shell
az --version
```

### Authenticate

```{note}
For more information on how to authenticate, refer to the [Juju documentation](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/juju/3.6/reference/cloud/list-of-supported-clouds/the-microsoft-azure-cloud-and-juju/#authentication-types) and [a dedicated user guide on how to register Azure on Juju](https://discourse.charmhub.io/t/how-to-use-juju-with-microsoft-azure/15219).
```

First of all, retrieve your subscription id:

```shell
az login
```

After authenticating via the web browser, you will be shown a list of information and a table with the subscriptions connected to your user, e.g.:

```shell
No     Subscription name                     Subscription ID                       Tenant
-----  ------------------------------------  ------------------------------------  -------------
[1] *  <subscription_name>                   <subscription_id>                     canonical.com
[2]    <other_subscription_name>             <other_subscription_id>               canonical.com
```

In the prompt, select the subscription id you would like to connect the controller to, and store the id
as it will be needed in the next step when bootstrapping the controller.

### Bootstrap Juju controller on Azure

First, you need to add a set of credentials to your Juju client:

```shell
juju add-credentials azure
```

This will start a script that will help you set up the credentials, where you will be asked:

* `credential-name` — a sensible name that will help you identify the credential set, say `<CREDENTIAL_NAME>`
* `region` — a default region that is most convenient to deploy your controller and applications. Note that credentials are not region-specific
* `auth type` — authentication type. Select `interactive`, which is the recommended way to authenticate to Azure using Juju
* `subscription_id` — the value `<subscription_id>` taken in the previous step
* `application_name` — any unique string to avoid collision with other users or applications
* `role-definition-name` — any unique string to avoid collision with other users or applications, and store it as `<AZURE_ROLE>`

Next, you will be asked to authenticate the requests via your web browser with the following message:

```shell
To sign in, use a web browser to open the page https://microsoft.com/devicelogin and enter the code <YOUR_CODE> to authenticate.
```

In the browser, open the [authentication page](https://microsoft.com/devicelogin) and enter the code `<YOUR_CODE>` provided in the output. 

You will be asked to authenticate twice, for allowing the creation of two different resources in Azure.

You will see a message that the credentials have been added locally:

```shell
Credential <CREDENTIAL_NAME> added locally for cloud "azure".
```

Once the credentials are correctly added, we can bootstrap a controller:

```shell
juju bootstrap azure <CONTROLLER_NAME>
```

## Deploy charms

Create a new Juju model, if needed:

```shell
juju add-model <MODEL_NAME>
```

(Optional) If you are troubleshooting charms and wish to see DEBUG logs:

```shell
juju model-config logging-config='<root>=INFO;unit=DEBUG'
```

Deploy Charmed Apache Kafka:

```shell
juju deploy kafka -n 3 --config roles=broker,controller [--constraints "instance-type=<INSTANCE_TYPE>"]
```

```{caution}
Note that the smallest instance types on Azure may not have enough resources for hosting 
an Apache Kafka broker. We recommend selecting an instance type that provides at the very least `8` GB of RAM and `4` cores, e.g. `Standard_A4_v2`.
For more guidance on production environment sizing, see the [Requirements page](reference-requirements).
You can find more information about the available instance types in the [Azure documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/sizes/overview).
```

We also recommend to deploy a [Data Integrator](https://charmhub.io/data-integrator) for creating an admin user to manage the content of the Kafka cluster:

```shell
juju deploy data-integrator \
  --config extra-user-roles=admin \
  --config topic-name=__admin-user
```

And integrate it with the Kafka application:

```shell
juju integrate kafka data-integrator
```

For more information on Data Integrator and how to use it, please refer to the [how-to manage applications](how-to-client-connections) guide.

## Clean up

```{caution}
Always clean Azure resources that are no longer necessary! Abandoned resources are tricky to detect and they can become expensive over time.
```

To list all controllers that have been registered to your local client, use the `juju controllers` command.

To destroy the Juju controller and remove the Azure instance (Warning: all your data will be permanently removed):

```shell
juju destroy-controller <CONTROLLER_NAME> --destroy-all-models --destroy-storage --force
```

Should the destroying process take a long time or be seemingly stuck, proceed to delete VM resources also manually 
via the Azure portal. See [Azure documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resources-portal) for more information 
on how to remove active resources no longer needed. 

Next, check and manually delete all unnecessary Azure VM instances, to show the list of all your Azure VMs run the following command (make sure to use the correct region): 

```shell
az resource list
```

List your Juju credentials with the `juju credentials` command.

<details>

<summary> Output example</summary>

```shell
Client Credentials:
Cloud        Credentials
azure        NAME_OF_YOUR_CREDENTIAL
```

</details>

Remove Azure CLI credentials from Juju:

```shell
juju remove-credential azure NAME_OF_YOUR_CREDENTIAL
```

After deleting the credentials, the `interactive` process may still leave the role resource and its assignment hanging around. 
We recommend checking if these are still present by running:

```shell
az role definition list --name <AZURE_ROLE>
```

To get the full list, use it without specifying the `--name` argument. 

You can check whether you still have a 
role assignment bound to `<AZURE_ROLE>` registered by using:

```shell
az role assignment list --role <AZURE_ROLE>
```

If there is an unwanted role left, you can remove the role assignment first and then the role itself with the following commands:

```shell
az role assignment delete --role <AZURE_ROLE>
az role definition delete --name <AZURE_ROLE>
```

Finally, log out from Azure CLI:

```shell
az logout 
```
