# How to set up monitoring

Charmed Apache Kafka K8s and Charmed Apache ZooKeeper K8s come with the [JMX exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/jmx_exporter/).
The metrics can be queried by accessing the `http://<kafka-unit-ip>:9101/metrics` and `http://<zookeeper-unit-ip>:9998/metrics` endpoints, respectively.

Additionally, the charm provides integration with the [Canonical Observability Stack](https://charmhub.io/topics/canonical-observability-stack).

## Enable monitoring

Deploy the `cos-lite` bundle in a Kubernetes environment. This can be done by following the
[deployment tutorial](https://charmhub.io/topics/canonical-observability-stack/tutorials/install-microk8s).

### Offer interfaces via the COS controller

Switch to COS K8s environment and offer COS interfaces to be cross-model related with Charmed Apache Kafka K8s model:

```shell
juju switch <k8s_controller>:<cos_model_name>

juju offer grafana:grafana-dashboard grafana-dashboards
juju offer loki:logging loki-logging
juju offer prometheus:receive-remote-write prometheus-receive-remote-write
```

### Consume offers via the Apache Kafka model

Switch back to the Charmed Apache Kafka K8s model, find offers and integrate with them:

```shell
juju switch <machine_controller_name>:<kafka_model_name>

juju find-offers <k8s_controller>:
```

A similar output should appear, if `k8s` is the K8s controller name and `cos` the model where `cos-lite` has been deployed:

```shell
Store      URL                                        Access  Interfaces
k8s        admin/cos.grafana-dashboards               admin   grafana_dashboard:grafana-dashboard
k8s        admin/cos.loki-logging                     admin   loki_push_api:logging
k8s        admin/cos.prometheus-receive-remote-write  admin   prometheus-receive-remote-write:receive-remote-write
...
```

Consume offers to be reachable in the current model:

```shell
juju consume <k8s_controller>:admin/<cos_model_name>.prometheus-receive-remote-write
juju consume <k8s_controller>:admin/<cos_model_name>.loki-logging
juju consume <k8s_controller>:admin/<cos_model_name>.grafana-dashboards
```

### Deploy and integrate Grafana

Deploy `grafana-agent-k8s`:

```shell
juju deploy grafana-agent-k8s --trust
```

Integrate it with consumed COS offers:

```shell
juju integrate grafana-agent-k8s grafana-dashboards
juju integrate grafana-agent-k8s loki-logging
juju integrate grafana-agent-k8s prometheus-receive-remote-write
```

Finally, integrate `grafana-agent` it with Charmed Apache Kafka K8s:

```shell
juju integrate grafana-agent-k8s kafka-k8s:grafana-dashboard
juju integrate grafana-agent-k8s kafka-k8s:logging
juju integrate grafana-agent-k8s kafka-k8s:metrics-endpoint
```

and Charmed Apache ZooKeeper K8s:

```shell
juju integrate grafana-agent-k8s zookeeper-k8s:grafana-dashboard
juju integrate grafana-agent-k8s zookeeper-k8s:logging
juju integrate grafana-agent-k8s zookeeper-k8s:metrics-endpoint
```

Wait for all components to settle down to the `active/idle` state on both models.

After this is complete, the monitoring COS stack should be up and running and ready to be used.

### Connect Grafana web interface

To connect to the Grafana web interface, follow the [Browse dashboards](https://charmhub.io/topics/canonical-observability-stack/tutorials/install-microk8s?_ga=2.201254254.1948444620.1704703837-757109492.1701777558#heading--browse-dashboards) section of the MicroK8s "Getting started" guide.

```shell
juju run grafana/leader get-admin-password --model <k8s_cos_controller>:<cos_model_name>
```

## Tune server logging level

To tune the level of the server logs for Apache Kafka and Apache ZooKeeper, configure the configuration accordingly.

For Charmed Apache Kafka K8s, configure the `log_level` parameter:

```shell
juju config <KAFKA_APP_NAME> log_level=<LOG_LEVEL>
```

```{tip}
See also: `log_level` configuration parameter [reference](https://charmhub.io/kafka/configurations#log_level).
```

Possible `LOG_LEVEL` values are: `ERROR`, `WARNING`, `INFO`, and `DEBUG`.

For Charmed Apache ZooKeeper, configure the `log-level` parameter:

```shell
juju config <ZOOKEEPER_APP_NAME> log-level=<LOG_LEVEL>
```

Possible `LOG_LEVEL` values are the same as above.

```{tip}
See also: `log-level` configuration parameter [reference](https://charmhub.io/zookeeper/configurations#log-level).
```

(how-to-monitoring-integrate-alerts-and-dashboards)=
## Alerts and dashboards

This guide shows you how to integrate an existing set of rules and/or dashboards to your Charmed Apache Kafka K8s and Charmed Apache ZooKeeper K8s deployment to be consumed with the [Canonical Observability Stack (COS)](https://charmhub.io/topics/canonical-observability-stack).
To do so, we will sync resources stored in a git repository to COS Lite.

### Prerequisites

Deploy the `cos-lite` bundle in a Kubernetes environment and integrate Charmed Apache Kafka K8s and Charmed Apache ZooKeeper K8s to the COS offers, as shown in the [How to Enable Monitoring](how-to-monitoring-enable-monitoring) guide.
This guide will refer to the models that charms are deployed into as:

* `<cos-model>` for the model containing observability charms (and deployed on K8s)
* `<apps-model>` for the model containing Charmed Apache Kafka K8s and Charmed Apache ZooKeeper K8s
* `<apps-model>` for other optional charms (e.g. TLS certificates operators, `grafana-agent`, `data-integrator`, etc.).

### Create a repository with a custom monitoring setup

Create an empty git repository, or in an existing one, save your alert rules and dashboard models under the `<path_to_prom_rules>`, `<path_to_loki_rules>` and `<path_to_models>` folders.

If you want an example of rule writing, refer to the [Prometheus documentation](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/alerting_rules/).  
You may also find an example in the [`kafka-test-app` repository](https://github.com/canonical/kafka-test-app).

Then, push your changes to the remote repository.

### Deploy the COS configuration charm

Deploy the [COS configuration](https://charmhub.io/cos-configuration-k8s) charm in the `<cos-model>` model:

```shell
juju deploy cos-configuration-k8s cos-config \
  --config git_repo=<repository_url> \
  --config git_branch=<branch> \
```

The COS configuration charm keeps the monitoring stack in sync with our repository, by forwarding resources to Prometheus, Loki and Grafana.
Refer to the [documentation](https://charmhub.io/cos-configuration-k8s/configure) for all configuration options, including how to access a private repository.  
Adding, updating or deleting an alert rule or a dashboard in the repository will be reflected in the monitoring stack.

```{note}
You need to manually refresh `cos-config`'s local repository with the *sync-now* action if you do not want to wait for the next [update-status event](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/juju/3.6/reference/hook/#update-status) to pull the latest changes.
```

### Forward the rules and dashboards

The path to the resource folders can be set after deployment:

```shell
juju config cos-config \
  --config prometheus_alert_rules_path=<path_to_prom_rules>
  --config loki_alert_rules_path=<path_to_loki_rules>
  --config grafana_dashboards_path=<path_to_models>
```

Then, integrate the charm to the COS operator to forward the rules and dashboards:

```shell
juju integrate cos-config prometheus
juju integrate cos-config grafana
juju integrate cos-config loki
```

After this is complete, the monitoring COS stack should be up, and ready to fire alerts based on our rules.
As for the dashboards, they should be available in the Grafana interface.

### Conclusion

In this guide, we enabled monitoring on a Charmed Apache Kafka K8s deployment and integrated alert rules and dashboards by syncing a git repository to the COS stack.
