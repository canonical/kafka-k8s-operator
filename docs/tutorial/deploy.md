# 2. Deploy Apache Kafka

This is a part of the [Charmed Apache Kafka K8s Tutorial](index.md).

## Deploy Charmed Apache Kafka K8s

To deploy Charmed Apache Kafka K8s, all you need to do is run the following commands, which will automatically fetch [Apache Kafka](https://charmhub.io/kafka?channel=4/edge) from [Charmhub](https://charmhub.io/) and deploy it to your model.

For example, to deploy a cluster of three Apache Kafka brokers, you can simply run:

```shell
juju deploy kafka-k8s -n 3 --channel 4/edge --roles=broker --trust
```

Apache Kafka also uses the KRaft consensus protocol for coordinating broker information, topic + partition metadata and Access Control Lists (ACLs), ran as a quorum of controller nodes using the Raft consensus algorithm.

```{note}
KRaft replaces the dependency on Apache ZooKeeper for metadata management. For more information on the differences between the two solutions, please refer to the [upstream Apache Kafka documentation](https://kafka.apache.org/40/documentation/zk2kraft.html)
```

Charmed Apache Kafka K8s can run both with `roles=broker` and/or `roles=controller`. With this configuration option, the charm can be deployed either as a single application running both Apache Kafka brokers and KRaft controllers, or as multiple applications with a separate controller cluster and broker cluster.

To deploy a cluster of three KRaft controllers, run:

```shell
juju deploy kafka -n 3 --channel 4/edge --roles=controller kraft --trust
```

After this, it is necessary to connect the two clusters, taking care to specify which cluster is the orchestrator:

```shell
juju integrate kafka-k8s:peer-cluster-orchestrator kraft:peer-cluster
```

Juju will now fetch Charmed Apache Kafka K8s and begin deploying both applications to the LXD cloud before connecting them to exchange access credentials and machine endpoints. This process can take several minutes depending on the resources available on your machine. You can track the progress by running:

```shell
watch -n 1 --color juju status --color
```

This command is useful for checking the status of both Charmed Apache Kafka K8s applications, and for gathering information about the machines hosting the two applications. Some of the helpful information it displays includes IP addresses, ports, status etc.
The command updates the status of the cluster every second and as the application starts you can watch the status and messages both applications change. 

Wait until the application is ready - when it is ready, `watch -n 1 --color juju status --color` will show:

```shell

## Access Apache Kafka brokers

Once all the units are shown as `active|idle`, the credentials can be retrieved.

All sensitive configuration data used by Charmed Apache Kafka K8s, such as passwords and SSL certificates, is stored in Juju secrets. See the [Juju secrets documentation](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/juju/3.6/reference/secret/) for more information.

To reveal the contents of the Juju secret containing sensitive cluster data for the Charmed Apache Kafka K8s application, you can run:

```shell
juju show-secret --reveal cluster.kafka.app
```

The output of the previous command will look something like this:

```shell
d2lj5jgco3bs3dacm2tg:
  revision: 1
  checksum: a6517abdd5e22038bfafe988e6253bb03c0462067b50475789eb6bc658ee0b11
  owner: kafka
  label: cluster.kafka.app
  created: 2025-08-24T15:42:13Z
  updated: 2025-08-24T15:42:13Z
  content:
    admin-password: dxpex3Uc1sWIBna83gELtJOhAuW2awji
    sync-password: eqI0RLV1lRSaIIiDKf3yz0W66ajICmDT
    internal-ca: |-
      <multi-line-certificate>
    internal-ca-key: |-
      <multi-line-private-key>
```

The important line here for accessing the Apache Kafka cluster itself is `admin-password`, which tells us that `username=admin` and `password=dxpex3Uc1sWIBna83gELtJOhAuW2awji`. These are the credentials to use to successfully authenticate to the cluster.

For simplicity, the password can also be directly retrieved by parsing the YAML response from the previous command directly using `yq`:

```shell
juju show-secret --reveal cluster.kafka.app | yq '.. | ."admin-password"? // empty' | tr -d '"'
```

```{caution}
When no other application is integrated to Charmed Apache Kafka K8s, the cluster is secured-by-default and external listeners (bound to port `9092`) are disabled, thus preventing any external incoming connection. 
```

We will also need a bootstrap server Apache Kafka broker address and port to initially connect to. When any application connects for the first time to a `bootstrap-server`, the client will automatically make a metadata request that returns the full set of Apache Kafka brokers with their addresses and ports.

To use `kafka-k8s/0` as the `bootstrap-server`, retrieve its IP address and add a port with:

```shell
bootstrap_address=$(juju show-unit kafka-k8s/0 | yq '.. | ."public-address"? // empty' | tr -d '"')

export BOOTSTRAP_SERVER=$bootstrap_address:19093
```

where `19093` refers to the available open internal port on the broker unit.

It is always possible to run a command from within the Apache Kafka cluster using the internal listeners and ports in place of the external ones. For an explanation of Charmed Apache Kafka K8s listeners, please refer to [Apache Kafka listeners](reference-broker-listeners).

To jump in to a running Charmed Apache Kafka K8s unit and run a command, for example listing files in a directory, you can do the following:

```shell
juju ssh --container kafka kafka-k8s/leader "ls /opt/kafka/bin/"
```

where the printed result will be the output from the `ls \$BIN/bin` command being executed on the `kafka-k8s` leader unit.

When the unit has started, the Charmed Apache Kafka K8s Operator installs the [`charmed-kafka`](https://snapcraft.io/charmed-kafka) snap in the unit that provides a number of snap commands (that corresponds to the shell-script `bin/kafka-*.sh` commands in the Apache Kafka distribution) for performing various administrative and operational tasks.

Within the machine, Charmed Apache Kafka K8s also creates a `$CONF/client.properties` file that already provides the relevant settings to connect to the cluster using the CLI.

For example, in order to create a topic, you can run:

```shell
juju ssh --container kafka kafka-k8s/0 \
    "/opt/kafka/bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --topic test_topic \
    --bootstrap-server $BOOTSTRAP_SERVER \
    --command-config /etc/kafka/client.properties"
```

You can similarly then list the topic, using:

```shell
juju ssh --container kafka kafka-k8s/0 \
    "/opt/kafka/bin/kafka-topics.sh --list \
    --bootstrap-server $BOOTSTRAP_SERVER \
    --command-config /etc/kafka/client.properties"
```

making sure the topic was successfully created.

You can finally delete the topic, using:

```shell
juju ssh --container kafka kafka-k8s/0 \
    "/opt/kafka/bin/kafka-topics.sh --delete \
    --topic test_topic \
    --bootstrap-server $BOOTSTRAP_SERVER \
    --command-config /etc/kafka/client.properties"
```

<!-- For a full list of the available Charmed Kafka command-line tools, please refer to [snap commands](reference-snap-commands). -->

## What's next?

Although the commands above can run within the cluster, it is generally recommended during operations to enable external listeners and use these for running the admin commands from outside the cluster.
To do so, as we will see in the next section, we will deploy a [data-integrator](https://charmhub.io/data-integrator) charm and integrate it to Charmed Apache Kafka K8s.
