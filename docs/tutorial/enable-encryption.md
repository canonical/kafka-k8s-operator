# 5. Enable encryption

This is a part of the [Charmed Apache Kafka K8s Tutorial](index.md).

## Transport Layer Security (TLS)

[TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) is used to encrypt data exchanged
between two applications; it secures data transmitted over the network.
Typically, enabling TLS within a highly available database, and between a highly available database
and client/server applications, requires domain-specific knowledge and a high level of expertise.
Fortunately, the domain-specific knowledge has been encoded into Charmed Apache Kafka K8s.
This means (re-)configuring TLS on Charmed Apache Kafka K8s is readily available and requires
minimal effort on your end.

Juju relations are particularly useful for enabling TLS.
For example, you can integrate Charmed Apache Kafka K8s to the
[Self-signed Certificates Charm](https://charmhub.io/self-signed-certificates)
using the [tls-certificates](https://charmhub.io/integrations/tls-certificates) interface.
The `tls-certificates` relation centralises TLS certificate management,
handling certificate provisioning, requests, and renewal.
This approach allows you to use different certificate providers,
including self-signed certificates or external services such as Let's Encrypt.

```{note}
In this tutorial, we will distribute
[self-signed certificates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-signed_certificate)
to all charms (Charmed Apache Kafka K8s and client applications) that are signed using
a root self-signed CA that is also trusted by all applications. 
This setup is only for testing and demonstrating purposes and self-signed certificates
are not recommended in a production cluster.
For more information about which charm may better suit your use-case, please see the
[Security with X.509 certificates](https://charmhub.io/topics/security-with-x-509-certificates) page.
```

### Configure TLS

Before enabling TLS on Charmed Apache Kafka K8s we must first deploy the `self-signed-certificates`
charm:

```shell
juju deploy self-signed-certificates --config ca-common-name="Tutorial CA"
```

Wait for the charm to settle into an `active/idle` state, as shown by the `juju status`:

```shell
Model     Controller        Cloud/Region         Version  SLA          Timestamp
tutorial  overlord          microk8s/localhost   3.6.8    unsupported  23:27:35Z

App                       Version  Status  Scale  Charm                     Channel  Rev  Exposed  Message
self-signed-certificates           active      1  self-signed-certificates  1/edge   336  no       

Unit                         Workload  Agent  Machine  Public address  Ports  Message
self-signed-certificates/0*  active    idle   7        10.233.204.134         

Machine  State    Address         Inst id        Base          AZ  Message
7        started  10.233.204.134  juju-07a730-7  ubuntu@24.04      Running
```

To enable TLS on Charmed Apache Kafka K8s, integrate with `self-signed-certificates` charm:

```shell
juju integrate kafka-k8s:certificates self-signed-certificates
```

After the charms settle into `active/idle` states, the Apache Kafka listeners should now have been swapped to the
default encrypted port 9093. This can be tested by testing whether the ports are open/closed with `telnet`:

```shell
telnet <IP> 9092 
telnet <IP> 9093
```

### Enable TLS encrypted connection

Once TLS is configured on the cluster side, client applications should be configured as well to connect to
the correct port and trust the self-signed CA provided by the `self-signed-certificates` charm.

Make sure that the `kafka-test-app` is not connected to the Charmed Apache Kafka K8s,
by removing the relation if it exists:

```shell
juju remove-relation kafka-test-app kafka-k8s
```

Then, enable encryption on the `kafka-test-app` by relating with the `self-signed-certificates` charm:

```shell
juju integrate kafka-test-app self-signed-certificates
```

We can then set up the `kafka-test-app` to produce messages with the usual configuration
(note that there is no difference here with the unencrypted workflow):

```shell
juju config kafka-test-app topic_name=HOT-TOPIC role=producer num_messages=25
```

Then integrate with the `kafka-k8s` cluster:

```shell
juju integrate kafka-k8s kafka-test-app
```

As before, you can check that the messages are pushed into the Apache Kafka cluster by inspecting the logs:

```shell
juju exec --application kafka-test-app "tail /tmp/*.log"
```

Note that if the `kafka-test-app` was running before, there may be multiple logs related to the different
runs. Refer to the latest logs produced and also check that in the logs the connection is indeed established
with the encrypted port `9093`.

### Remove external TLS certificate

To remove the external TLS and return to the locally generated one, remove relation with certificates provider:

```shell
juju remove-relation kafka-k8s self-signed-certificates
```

The Charmed Apache Kafka K8s application is not using TLS anymore for client connections.
