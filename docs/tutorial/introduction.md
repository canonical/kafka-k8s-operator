# Tutorial
<!-- # Charmed Apache Kafka K8s tutorial -->

The Charmed Apache Kafka K8s Operator delivers automated operations management from [Day 0 to Day 2](https://codilime.com/blog/day-0-day-1-day-2-the-software-lifecycle-in-the-cloud-age/) on the [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) event streaming platform.
It is an open source, end-to-end, production-ready data platform [on top of Juju](https://juju.is/). As a first step this tutorial shows you how to get Charmed Apache Kafka K8s up and running, but the tutorial does not stop there.
Through this tutorial, you will learn a variety of operations, everything from adding replicas to advanced operations such as enabling SSL encryption, cross-cluster asynchronous replication and more.

In this tutorial, we will walk through how to:

- Set up your local environment using Multipass, MicroK8s and Juju.
- Deploy Charmed Apache Kafka K8s using only a few commands.
- Get the admin credentials directly.
- Add high-availability with replication.
- Change the admin password.
- Automatically create Apache Kafka users via Juju relations.
- Use Cruise Control for cluster rebalancing.
- Use Apache Kafka Connect for moving data between data applications.
<!-- - Use Karapace for schema management and message serialisation. -->

While this tutorial intends to guide and teach you as you deploy Charmed Apache Kafka K8s,
it will be most beneficial if you already have a familiarity with:

- Basic Unix shell commands.
- General data-intensive application concepts such as partitioning, replication and user management.

## Minimum requirements

- Ubuntu 24.04 (Noble) or later.
