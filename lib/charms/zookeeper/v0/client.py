"""ZooKeeperManager and ZooKeeperClient classes

`ZooKeeperManager` provides an interface for performing actions that requires 
a connection to the current ZK quorum leader, e.g updating zNodes, ACLs and quorum members.
On `__init__`, it loops through all passed hosts, attempts a `ZooKeeperClient` connection, and 
checks leadership of each unit, storing the current quorum leader host as an attribute.

In most cases, custom `Exception`s raised by `ZooKeeperManager` should trigger an `event.defer()`,
as they indicate that the servers are not ready to have actions performed upon them just yet.

`ZooKeeperClient` serves as a handler for managing a ZooKeeper client connection to a
single unit. It's methods contain common 4lw commands, and functionality to read/write
to specific zNodes.
It is not expected to use this class from directly from charm code,
but to instead use the `ZooKeeperManager` class to perform it's actions on the ZK servers.


Instances of `ZooKeeperManager` are to be created by methods in either the `Charm` itself,
or from another library.

Example usage for `ZooKeeperManager`:

```python

def update_cluster(new_members: List[str], event: EventBase) -> None:
    
    try:
        zk = ZooKeeperManager(
            hosts=["10.141.73.20", "10.141.73.21"],
            client_port=2181,
            username="super",
            password="password"
        )
        
        current_quorum_members = zk.server_members

        servers_to_remove = list(current_quorum_members - new_members)
        zk.remove_members(servers_to_remove)
        
        servers_to_add = sorted(new_members - current_quorum_members)
        zk.add_members(servers_to_add)

    except (
        MembersSyncingError,
        MemberNotReadyError,
        QuorumLeaderNotFoundError,
    ) as e:
        logger.info(str(e))
        event.defer()
